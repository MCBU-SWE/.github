General
The students will form project teams with 
5 to 7 people for Scrum, 
3 ‚Äì 5 people for Kanban and 
4 - 6 people for XP. 

During the semester, the project team will work together through the full development cycle, applying the principles of SCRUM, XP or Kanban, from understanding the requirements to delivering a functioning product, and making a series of presentations of the work to the client. A project management tool is a must, which is 25 % of your project grade.

Requirements engineering phase of the project must include all steps, Requirements elicitation, Requirements analysis, Requirements validation and Requirements management.

Classification of requirements must be done in two ways (functional-nonfunctional and (user-system). Specification of the requirements must be done properly.

Scenarios and task cards must be prepared. The tasks to be handled (implemented) in each sprint must be chosen.

Any change in the requirements during the process must be reported.

System boundaries must be clearly defined. 
UML will be used for sequence, state and class diagrams.

Object classes will be identified clearly.

Unit testing is compulsory. JUnit will be installed and used for unit tests. (20% of your grade)

Keeping track of the error messages is compulsory. Classification of error messages (numbers, frequency) like syntax errors, logical errors, runtime errors, etc. 

Apply the IEEE standard for the requirements document, which is given in the slides of Chapter 4. 
Projects
Every project should have a client. This client can be virtual, but the team has to behave as a client to obtain necessary requirements then. Every project should be chosen by at least one team. The projects to be chosen by the teams are given below:

    1. Project #1 Real Estate Site
    2. Project #2 Grocery Delivery Site
    3. Project #3 Online Technology Store
    4. Project #4 Library Site
    5. Project #6 Online Pet Adopting Site

Deliverables
Since every software project is different, there is no set list of deliverables that every project must provide. Part of your task is to decide what is needed for this specific project. Typical deliverables include working code, documentation, training materials, etc. Your reports should include the following:
    1. Feasibility study and plan (report)
    2. Requirements (presentation and documentation)
    ‚Ä¢ Determine functional & non functional requirements classify them. Use some metrics if needed
    ‚Ä¢ Determine user requirements
    ‚Ä¢ Convert them to system requirements
    ‚Ä¢ Determine the system stakeholders
    ‚Ä¢ Discuss about your requirements‚Äô being complete and consistent
    ‚Ä¢ State your usability requirements
    ‚Ä¢ Follow the requirements engineering process order (Elicitation, Analysis, Validation and Management)
    ‚Ä¢ What are your possible problems in these process steps? State and discuss solutions
    ‚Ä¢ Create your stories and user scenarios and break them into tasks
    ‚Ä¢ Use structured specification for your requirements
    ‚Ä¢ Apply requirements checking
    ‚Ä¢ Do you foresee any changes in your system? If so, what do you plan to make changes?
    ‚Ä¢ Determine the system boundaries in detail
    ‚Ä¢ Draw your use case, state, class and sequence diagrams
    ‚Ä¢ Draw and explain your architectural design
    3. Design (presentation and documentation)
    4. Final delivery (presentation and documentation)
The three primary criteria for a successful project are: satisfying the client's needs, usability of the product, and maintainability over the life of the product.

Technical environment
Projects will use Java or C#. For mobile applications, you are free to choose the programming language and the development environment.¬† 

Expectations from the client
The client can expect the following from the students:
    ‚Ä¢ A careful study of the requirements and a design that meets those requirements.
    ‚Ä¢ A tested and well documented system that performs as specified.¬†
In return, the student can expect the following from the client:
    ‚Ä¢ Regular meetings, about weekly.
    ‚Ä¢ Feedback on draft documentation.
Reports & Presentations
Each group will submit a report at the 10th week of the semester including the first 3 topics of the deliverables. The groups are supposed to make a presentation at the end of the semester. 

Important Note: The development steps of your project should be in progress
